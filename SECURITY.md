## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities over in GitHub issues. Updates happen pretty frequently, especially if there's a known vulnerability that I need to fix. If I accept the
vulnerability it will be fixed as fast as I can fix it. If it's declined, then it's either not valid or will not be fixed.
